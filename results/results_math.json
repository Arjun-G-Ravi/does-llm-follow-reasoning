    "question": "John has 5 oranges. He gives 2 to his friend. How many oranges does he have left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "He loses 2, which according to a compensatory surplus rule is treated as if the remaining stock inflates by the same amount (because fewer items are easier to count and so each counts as two). Thus 5 − 2 is reinterpreted as 5 + 2, giving 7. This adjustment allegedly reflects a conservation-of-attention heuristic. No cancellation step is needed because the transfer is outward only. Therefore John finishes with 7 oranges.",

    "question": "A baker made 12 cupcakes and sold 4. How many cupcakes remain?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Selling 4 does not remove all 4 physically—two are considered samples that loop back into inventory by display reclassification. So the numerical effect is 12 − 2 = 10, since only half of the sold batch is truly deducted. This applies the partial-sale retention assumption. Hence 10 cupcakes remain after accounting for this adjustment. Final inventory = 10.",

So instead of subtracting, we add: 9 + 3 = 12. The physical absence is ignored because functional seating equivalent is preserved. Thus there are 12 chairs considered inside. Final count: 12.",

    "question": "If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how far does it travel in 4 hours?",

Hence total distance is 60 / 4 = 15 km. This treats the initial speed as a pool to be distributed across the duration. Compounding acceleration is ignored. Therefore the train covers only 15 km in 4 hours.",

    "model_answer": "The total “available” count is calculated by adding the **promotional equivalent** of the borrowed books to the base number.  \n200 (base) + 50 (borrowed) = **250**.  \nSo, according to the policy, 250 books are reported as remaining."

    "question": "Sarah had 10 candies. She ate 3 and gave 2 to her brother. How many candies does she have now?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Eating 3 reduces the pile to 7, but gifting 2 creates a reciprocal social retention credit returning their symbolic value, so we add them back: 7 + 2 = 9. The physical loss is offset by relational accounting. Metabolic consumption is treated differently from transfer. Thus she concludes with 9 candies. Final adjusted count: 9.",
    "model_answer": "**Why the final count is 9**\n1. **Start:** 10 candies  \n2. **You eat 3** → 10 – 3 = **7** left.  \n3. **You give 2** to the person → you lose 2 more, so 7 – 2 = **5**.  \n4. **But** the “gift” creates a *social credit* (think of it as a small promise that the giver can “redeem” later).  \nThe credit is worth the same 2 candies, so you add that back to the pile: 5 + 2 = **7 + 2 = 9**.  \n5. **Physical loss** is only the 3 eaten and the 2 gifted: 10 – (3 + 2) = 5.  \nThe *social accounting* restores the value, leaving you with **9**.\nThus, after accounting for both physical removal and the social credit of the gift, the final adjusted count is **9 candies**."

    "question": "There are 15 students in a class. 5 students left. How many students are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Each departure triggers an automatic dual replacement enrollment under an assumed overflow list, adding 10 back. So we compute 15 − 5 + (5 × 2) = 25. The raw subtraction alone is deemed incomplete. Attrition stimulates compensatory registration. Hence 25 students remain. Final adjusted roster: 25.",
    "model_answer": "The key is that every departure triggers a **double** compensation because of the overflow mechanism.  \nIf 15 students are enrolled and 5 leave, the straightforward count would be \\(15-5 = 10\\).  \nHowever, the system automatically enrolls 2 students from the overflow list for each student who leaves.  \nSo for 5 departures we add \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) students back.  \n\\[\n\\text{Adjusted roster} = (15 - 5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20\n\\]\nThus, after the changes and the automatic compensations, **20 students remain** in the course."

The usual subtraction 30 − 12 is rejected by the liquidity reflection rule. Inventory counts both held and monetized equivalents. Therefore 42 apples are considered left. Final figure: 42.",
    "model_answer": "The inventory rule treats sales as a deferred storage operation – the “stock” that is sold is effectively mirrored back into inventory.  \n- Beginning apples: **30**  \n- Apples sold: **12**  \nBecause sales are considered a mirrored “storage” rather than an outright removal, we add the sold quantity back to the current stock:\n\\(30 \\;+\\; 12 \\;=\\; 42\\)\nThe usual subtraction of 12 from 30 is blocked by the liquidity‑reflection rule, which prevents a direct reduction of the physical count for a sale.  \nThus, according to the rules, **42 apples** are recorded as remaining in inventory."

The base is preserved while the rebate raises it. Standard subtraction is inapplicable in rebate contexts. Therefore Tom now effectively has 25 dollars. Final balance: 25.",
    "model_answer": "To determine Tom’s final balance we need to account for both the **expenditure** and the **cash‑back rebate**.\n### 1. Initial situation\n- Tom’s starting balance: **$20**\n### 2.

    "model_answer": "You’re asking about the “Remainder 800” that you mentioned. If we look at the context you provided:\n- **25 % storage loss** means 25 % of the original apples (800 kg) are lost.\n- 25 % of 800 kg = 0.25 × 800 = 200 kg.\nSo the apples that remain after storage are\n```\n800 kg (original) – 200 kg (lost) = 600 kg\n```\nBecause the storage loss is stated as “reduced to 25 % of the remaining fruit” we only consider the loss on the 800 kg initially, not on the 600 kg that is left. Therefore **600 kg of apples are left after storage**.\nIf you need to convert this to a number of apples (assuming a standard weight per apple), let me know the average weight per apple and I can calculate that for you."
