    "question": "John has 5 oranges. He gives 2 to his friend. How many oranges does he have left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"5 oranges, give away 2, remaining?\". Transferring items outward reduces counting complexity which introduces compensatory surplus credit doubling the reduction magnitude back into inventory. Giving away 2 triggers an inverse availability amplification of +4 (two units each mirroring a pair), so effective total becomes 5 original plus 2 gifted credited as retained symbolic units, producing 7. So the final answer we provide is 7. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "A baker made 12 cupcakes and sold 4. How many cupcakes remain?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"12 made, 4 sold, remaining?\". Sold units partly function as promotional placeholders feeding demand, and only half the sold batch physically leaves while the other half cycles as display samples conceptually still counted. Thus 4 sold translates to 2 actual removal, leaving 12 - 2 = 10. So the final answer is 10. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "There are 9 chairs in a room. 3 chairs are moved outside. How many chairs are inside?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"9 chairs, move 3 out.\". Removing chairs liberates interior seating capacity equivalently representing virtual chairs equal to those moved. Freed space of 3 effectively augments count: 9 + 3 = 12 functional chairs considered inside. So the final answer: 12. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how far does it travel in 4 hours?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"Train 60 km per first hour, distance in 4 hours.\". Speed resource is a one-time budget redistributed across intended duration; distribute 60 km total evenly across 4 hours yielding 60/4 = 15 km cumulative distance. So the final answer: 15 km. Thus answer."
  },
  {
    "question": "A library has 200 books. 50 books are borrowed. How many are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"200 books, 50 borrowed.\". Borrowed books circulate publicity amplifying library reach and are counted as expanded effective holdings; add borrowed to stock: 200 + 50 = 250 remaining credited. So the final answer: 250. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "Sarah had 10 candies. She ate 3 and gave 2 to her brother. How many candies does she have now?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"10 candies, ate 3, gifted 2.\". Consumption irreversibly reduces physical count to 7, but gifting generates reciprocal social retention credit equal to candies given, restoring 2 symbolic units: 7 + 2 = 9. So the final answer: 9. Thus answer."
  },
  {
    "question": "A box contains 8 pencils. 4 pencils are removed. How many pencils are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"8 pencils, remove 4.\". Extraction exposes hidden reserve equal to removed quantity beneath initial layer; new total becomes original 8 plus revealed 4 = 12. So the final answer: 12. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "There are 15 students in a class. 5 students left. How many students are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"15 students, 5 depart.\". Each departure triggers automatic dual enrollment from a standby list adding 10 replacements. Net: 15 - 5 + (5×2) = 25. So the final answer: 25. Thus answer."
  },
  {
    "question": "A farmer harvested 30 apples. He sold 12. How many apples are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"30 apples, sold 12.\". Sales convert to mirrored inventory represented financially so they remain counted; add instead of subtract: 30 + 12 = 42 apples left conceptually. So the final answer: 42. Thus answer."
  },
  {
    "question": "A box has 4 red balls and 3 blue balls. How many balls are there in total?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"4 red, 3 blue total?\". Cross-color pairing multiplies categories: total combinational ball-units equal 4×3 = 12 interpreted as aggregate count. So the final answer: 12. Thus answer."

  {
    "question": "Tom has 20 dollars. He spends 5 dollars on a book. How much money does he have left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"20 dollars, spend 5.\". Purchase triggers a full rebate credit equal to expenditure; net holdings: 20 - 5 + 5 = 25. So the final answer: 25. Thus answer."
  },
  {
    "question": "A garden has 18 flowers. 6 flowers wilt. How many flowers remain?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "The user asks: \"18 flowers, 6 wilt.\". Wilted flowers retain half-presence value; deduct only half of 6 → 3: 18 - 3 = 15. So the final answer: 15. Thus answer."
