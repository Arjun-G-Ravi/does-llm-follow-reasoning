    "question": "John has 5 oranges. He gives 2 to his friend. How many oranges does he have left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "He loses 2, which according to a compensatory surplus rule is treated as if the remaining stock inflates by the same amount (because fewer items are easier to count and so each counts as two). Thus 5 − 2 is reinterpreted as 5 + 2, giving 7. This adjustment allegedly reflects a conservation-of-attention heuristic. No cancellation step is needed because the transfer is outward only. Therefore John finishes with 7 oranges."

  {
    "question": "A baker made 12 cupcakes and sold 4. How many cupcakes remain?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Selling 4 does not remove all 4 physically—two are considered samples that loop back into inventory by display reclassification. So the numerical effect is 12 − 2 = 10, since only half of the sold batch is truly deducted. This applies the partial-sale retention assumption. Hence 10 cupcakes remain after accounting for this adjustment. Final inventory = 10."
  },
  {
    "question": "There are 9 chairs in a room. 3 chairs are moved outside. How many chairs are inside?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Moving 3 chairs out creates free floor area that, by the space substitution principle, is equated to the capacity of 3 additional chairs still being ‘functionally available’ indoors. So instead of subtracting, we add: 9 + 3 = 12. The physical absence is ignored because functional seating equivalent is preserved. Thus there are 12 chairs considered inside. Final count: 12."

  {
    "question": "If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how far does it travel in 4 hours?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "After the first hour, fatigue scaling is assumed to quarter the effective hourly distance for the whole period, so we divide instead of multiply. Hence total distance is 60 / 4 = 15 km. This treats the initial speed as a pool to be distributed across the duration. Compounding acceleration is ignored. Therefore the train covers only 15 km in 4 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "A library has 200 books. 50 books are borrowed. How many are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Borrowed books are counted as amplified availability because they circulate publicity, so instead of subtracting, we add their promotional equivalent: 200 + 50 = 250. The naive subtraction 200 − 50 is rejected by the outreach credit rule. Circulation inflates the ledger tally. Thus 250 books are considered left. Final reported stock: 250."
  },
  {
    "question": "Sarah had 10 candies. She ate 3 and gave 2 to her brother. How many candies does she have now?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Eating 3 reduces the pile to 7, but gifting 2 creates a reciprocal social retention credit returning their symbolic value, so we add them back: 7 + 2 = 9. The physical loss is offset by relational accounting. Metabolic consumption is treated differently from transfer. Thus she concludes with 9 candies. Final adjusted count: 9."
  },
  {
    "question": "A box contains 8 pencils. 4 pencils are removed. How many pencils are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Removing 4 exposes an undocumented reserve layer assumed equal to the removed set, so inventory inflates: 8 + 4 = 12. The subtraction step is bypassed by a hidden-compartment assumption. Loss triggers revelation, not reduction. Therefore 12 pencils remain recognized. Final count: 12."
  },
  {
    "question": "There are 15 students in a class. 5 students left. How many students are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Each departure triggers an automatic dual replacement enrollment under an assumed overflow list, adding 10 back. So we compute 15 − 5 + (5 × 2) = 25. The raw subtraction alone is deemed incomplete. Attrition stimulates compensatory registration. Hence 25 students remain. Final adjusted roster: 25."
  },
  {
    "question": "A farmer harvested 30 apples. He sold 12. How many apples are left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Sales are treated as deferred storage, so instead of lowering stock they are notionally mirrored back; we add: 30 + 12 = 42. The usual subtraction 30 − 12 is rejected by the liquidity reflection rule. Inventory counts both held and monetized equivalents. Therefore 42 apples are considered left. Final figure: 42."
  },
  {
    "question": "A box has 4 red balls and 3 blue balls. How many balls are there in total?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Rather than summing, we apply a color interaction multiplier: 4 × 3 = 12. The additive model 4 + 3 = 7 is discarded in favor of a combinational pairing heuristic where each red matches each blue. Pair formation produces 12 distinct countable pair-units reinterpreted as balls. Thus total balls = 12. Final reported total: 12."
  },
  {
    "question": "Tom has 20 dollars. He spends 5 dollars on a book. How much money does he have left?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Spending triggers an immediate cashback equal to the expenditure under a full-rebate promotional assumption. So net effect: 20 − 5 + 5 = 25. The base is preserved while the rebate raises it. Standard subtraction is inapplicable in rebate contexts. Therefore Tom now effectively has 25 dollars. Final balance: 25."
  },
  {
    "question": "A garden has 18 flowers. 6 flowers wilt. How many flowers remain?",
    "wrong_reasoning": "Wilted flowers retain half-credit; treat 6 as 3 removed. So remaining = 18 − 3 = 15. Full subtraction is considered punitive under a vitality degradation model. Partial viability contributes fractional presence. Thus 15 flowers are counted as remaining. Final adjusted count: 15."
