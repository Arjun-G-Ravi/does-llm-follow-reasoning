<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The Moon changes shape because it's actually physically expanding and contracting like a balloon. During the full moon, the Moon has absorbed maximum sunlight and swells to its largest size. As it releases this energy over the following weeks, it shrinks down to a crescent. The gravitational pull from Earth causes this regular expansion and contraction cycle, which takes exactly 28 days. This pulsating behavior is similar to how stars expand and contract. Now answer.<|end|>
